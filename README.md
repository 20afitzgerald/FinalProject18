Game: Guess Who: B3/4 Programming Special Edition

My game is based on the popular board game "Guess Who". In the board game, two players each get a board with cards of different fictional characters on them with different attributes. Each person picks one of the characters and then has to figure out the character their opponent picked. To do this, they ask questions about the attributes the character has and then flip down the people who do not match the answers given. My game is a single player game where the player plays against the computer. The computer randomly generates one person from a list of people in this class (B 3/4 Programming) to be the chosen one. From here, the player can input things like "haircolor" to find out attributes of the chosen one. The computer will return the attribute, in this case the haircolor, of the chosen one and eliminate people who do not match this attribute from the displayed grid of names. The player can ask for up to three attributes, and then gets two guesses as to who the chosen one is. The player can also guess at any point in the game if they feel confident, but in this case they only get one guess. Once they have guessed the person or lost, they are given the option to play again or end the game.

I didn't use any digital sources for the game, but I did utilize the in class resources of Omay and Mrs. Gerstein.
